 * Class Location - a location on the map of an adventure game.

 * This class is part of the "World of Zuul" application.
 * "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.
 *
 * A "Location" represents one place in the scenery of the game.  It is
 * connected to other locations via exits.  For each existing exit, the
 * location stores a reference to the neighboring locations.
